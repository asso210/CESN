# CESN
A new neural network architecture for time series classification and regression. 

# CESN architecture
Here we present and describe in detail a new neural network architecture called CESN, Convolutional Echo State Network, which results from the combination of the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the Echo State Networks (ESNs). CESN results to be appropriate for Time Series Classification (TSC) tasks and Time Series Regression (TSR) tasks, just changing the output activation function and the loss function of the model. 
CESN architecture in details is shown in the figure below
